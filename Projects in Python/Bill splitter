#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

z = (float(totalbill) +(float(totalbill)* (float(Tip) / 100)))/int(people)

print( "Each person should pay :  â‚¹" + str(round(z,3)))
print("â‚¹"+ str(round(z2,2)))

# here round function doesnt show the 2 decimal as the number is teminating like 10.6 so zero doont show even after use of round function 
#  to solve this we use format function which allows us to change the display format 
print( "Each person should pay :  â‚¹" + str("{:.2f}".format(round(z,3))))
print( "Each person should pay :  â‚¹" + str("{:.2f}".format(z)))
# doesnt need round function if we use format to print decimal places
