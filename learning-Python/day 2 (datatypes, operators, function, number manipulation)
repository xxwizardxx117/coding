# (1)       **********************************  Data Types  ******************************************

# 1   strings

"hello"
#are written in double quotes 

print("hello"[0])#prints single character of string 
#always start from zero 
#######    the method to take single character is called subscripting     #######

######    the number in square brackets determines the which character to take or choose (goes from 0 to n)     ######
# example (to print o form hello we do )
print ("hello"[4])



# 2 integers

#if we write a code like 
print ("345"+"4567")
# +**************it is a string not integer *****************

#in python to write integer we directly write  the numbers 
# example 
print (123 + 345 + 445)
# when we write large numbers we can use "_"as the comma that we use to use in maths for example 6,53,123 in indian system 
# here compiler takes it as a single no., not a different one 
# example
print (6_53_123)



# 3 float

#just using the decimal in between the number makes it a floating point number 
# example we want to print  3.23214
# So we do it like this 
print(3.14159)



# 4 boolean 

# it only has 2 values 
# 1.   True 
# 2.   False 
# we use the above two with both having 1st letter as capital
# example 
True
False













# (2)                   **************               functions              *******************



# previously we used the len function to find the length of the string but we got an error when we did something like this 
num_char = len (input ("what is your name ?"))
# print ("your name is "+ num_char +" characters long")

# here(above line of code which is commented) we get the  error because of the use of different data types being used all together 
# string + integer is happening which is wrong 
# hence the error



# 1  type ( ) function 

# simlar to len to check we use type function to check the data type of anything 
# example 
print (type (num_char))
# hence in above print statement "your name is "+ num_char  doesnt make any sense  
# example 2
print(type(len(input("what is your name ?"))))
 


# 2   str ( ) function ---->   Type casting or type conversion  

# to do type casting we use a function called str() [ str covert to string data type ]
# example 
new_num_char =str(num_char)
print (type (new_num_char))
# here we took int into str function which convrts data to string and then stored the new thing into the new_num_char variable)
#the above code can be used in the problem that we faced in between line 75 & line 76

# ******************************* data type conversion list *****************************************
# to convert we use 

#           SYNTAX        new variable = data_type(the thing to be converted)
# a=int()
# a=float()
# a=str()



# 3   round() function ---->   Used to round of numbers
# in python we use round function to convert the decimal or floating numbers to whole numbers (to eleminate trailing digits after the decimal)
# example 
print (round (5649.49857564577))

# we can also round of our trailing digits to specified digts easily in python by using the command as follows 
# we use a comma after using the normal round function to specify the number of the digits needed to be shown in the output 
# example 
print (round (45.77766767564, 2))













# (3)        ****************************   Mathematical Operators  ****************************

# 1 + sign 
# we saw it being used for joning sentences and adding things 
# example 
print(3+5)

# 2 "-"sign 
# it is used to do subtration 
# example 
print(45-40)

# 3 "*" sign
# it is used lto perform multiplication operation
# example 
print(3*3)

# 4 "/"sign 
# it is used to divide  operation 
# example 
print(6/3)
# when we divide we get result in float it happens in python and is normal

# 5 "**" sign
# it is the raise to the power operation  
# example 
print(2**5)




# ********* things to remember when using operations 

# 1 when more no of operators are there need to follow priority order 
# PEMDAS          (BODMAS)
# PYRENTHESIS ()    BRACKET 
# EXPONENT    **    ORDER

# THE  BELOW HAVE  SAME LEVEL OF ATHORITY OR PRIORITY 
#             **********calculation is done from left to right***********
# DIVISION     /    DIVISION     MULTIPLICATION *  MULTIPLICATION
# ADDITION     +    ADDITION     SUBTRACTION  -    SUBTRACTION
#             **********calculation is done from left to right***********
