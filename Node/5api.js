// we will learn 
// api
// rest api
// we wont be learning the restful api 
// as it is TOPIC in itself
// we will be learning the basics of api

// API stands for Application Programming Interface
// it is a set of rules that allow two software programs to communicate with each other
// it acts as a messenger between two programs or a middle man
// for eg facebook we see loading screen and then data is visible
// here the facebook reaches out to the backend server with help of an api and then the data is visible




// * REST API -> (REpresentational State Transfer)
// REST -> means representing data by shareing  after processing it 



// for example during learning promises
// we imported data of 10 users using a url 
// here the url is the api as it is a set of rules that allow two software programs to communicate with each other
// then the data is processed by server of host site and then fetched and then we can use it
