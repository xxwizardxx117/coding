<!-- 
    
    js has a limitation that is that it cant run outside of the browser

    node js can work outside of browser , it can interact with other servers , it can work on iot devices and do more stuff-->


        <!-- node js is an open source and cross platform runtime environment 
        
        what is runtime environment?

            in general we mean it is the time when the program is executing -->



      *<!-- node js is a runtime environment for executing javascript code outside of the browser -->



            <!--  -chrome v8 is runtime environment for chorme->
            <!--  - chakra is runtime environment for edge  -->
            <!-- spider monkey is runtime environment for mozilla -->




        <!-- why runtime is imoportant? 
        
            as it provides the required apis to execute the code --
            as it provides the required libraries to execute the code
            as it provides the acess to the global objects to execute the code
            as it provides the asess to the hard ware resources to execute the code
        
        -->



        <!-- why is node js more important 
        
            *it has no dom
            *it has no doccumnet (as it has global document)

            the feature that make it invaluable are
             *it is single-threaded and one core   
             core are object of processor which do jobs
             single threaded means that it uses only one thread and one core to execute the code 
             so if we have 4 cores and 4 threads then it will use only one core and one thread to execute the code
             if we use all and each node package can entertain 1000 servers the a total of 4000 servers can be entertained
             its not possible with other programming languages as they use more than one core and more than one thread to execute the code
             *non-blocking I/O
             we saw asynchronous and synchronous concept where synchronous task get executed first (in real time) and then asynchronous task get executed (as they need time to execute)
             but node js doesnt do this it treats theem equally and executes them at the same time
             so no blocking I/O
        -->




        <!--* npm -->
        <!--
            what is mpm ?
            npm is a package manager for javascript
            it is a command line tool that installs, updates or uninstalls node packages    
            its full form is node package manager 

            why it is called a packet manager
            as it manages (unpacks bundels) the packages of node js code which is bundeled         -->


        <!--* PORTS -->
         <!-- 
        it is entry point for the servers
        it is a gateway through which external services can enter your system
            examples are 
            databases 
            authentication services
            security services
            payment gateways 
        WE CAN HAVE AS MANY AS PORTS WE NEED BUT NO 2 SERVERS SHOULD HAVE SAME PORTS-->



        <!-- *HEADERS -->
         <!-- 
                CONNECTION
            A----------------B
            SERVER A        SERVER B
            THERE IS ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH GETS SHARED ALSO 
            THIS IS CALLED HEADERS
            it is in a coded format we cant understand
        -->


        <!-- *HTTPS -->
        <!-- 
            https status codes-- these are numeric codes to define certain situations(states)
            error msgs like 404 not found
            they canbe
            1. sucess --200
            2. failure  ---404( not available)
                        ---401 (unauthorized)
                        ---403 (authorized but forbidden to acess)
            3. seever error--500 -->



        <!-- *JSON -->
        <!-- 
            json is shortend format to share data (exchange) betweeen two servers
         -->




         <!-- node js is used because if  we have some external package then and we want toinclude them in our JSON then we need to install them using node -->
        <!-- we install external packages using npm i package name -->
        <!-- we will use internal packets in the  begining -->
        <!-- 1. file system  -->
        <!-- 2. http  -->
        <!-- 3. url  -->
        <!-- 4. path  -->
