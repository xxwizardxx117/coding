// (as a result the card comes on right adjecent to the previous card)




// after the data is stored in the object and the new card is made we need to store the data of the user in the local storage so that it can be used later on and doesnt go away on refreshing the page



// here we use push method of array to input data from task data
// here we cant push the data directly as it is an object so we need to convert it into a string  use of jason is here
// local storage doesnt take data in the form of object so we need to convert it into a string

// storage call + method ( id , json.stringify(data))
// here we use local storage to store the data of the user with a new id tasky
// it means in local storage using its method setitem we add an item into the local storage
// normally the data stored is in obhect form but local storage doesnt take data in the form of object so we need to convert it into a string
// we use jason.stringify to convert the data into a string
// but stringy takes key value pair so we need to make a key value pair as a result we use {card:globalstore}
// local storage is a browser storage so it gets shared by  all the projct to avoid this we use the id to store it 



// * after the data is stored in the local storage we need a function to load the data from the local storage to the browser on each refresh

// what is the parent of any dom 
// answer it is documment so whenever we nee to acess something using the id class we need to document.




// WE WANT OUR DATA TO NOT GET DELETED WHEN PAGE REFRESHES 


// we dont have a data base 
// so we cant store data  
//      SO WE HAVE TO MAKE LOCAL STORAGE  
//     LOCAL STORAGE - it acts as a meadiator which allows  application acess via storage 
//     IT ALLOWS  pages TO locally store named key/value pairs inside a clientâ€™s Web browser.  
//     anything stored inside local storage is never lost even on refresh as it is stored in browser 
//     it can be acessed using JS code as we make a local storage object there  
//     API (application programming interface) - this is a api  LIKE (small part of API) process(local storage acts like an api)  
//     INTERFACE - means to be a middle man (so here local storage acts as an interface) 
    
// WE WANT ADD FEATURES LIKE EDIT DELETE OPEN THE CARD  





// API - API is a interface which allows communcation b/w two different components like weather bureau's system which has data and mobile device through we are trying to acess that data  
// API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. 
// sender is sender and receiver is client 
// api can work in 4 ways based on there time of creation 
// 1 SOAP APIS 
// 2 REST APIS 
//   RPC APIS    
// 3 Websocket APIS 
// 3 GRAPHQL APIS 
// 4 GRPC APIS
